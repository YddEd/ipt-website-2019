                Communication systems enable people to send and receive data and information. 
                With the introduction of the telephone, radio, television and internet, our dependance on communication systems have greatly increased. <br>
                All communication systems have <b>five basic components</b><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The <b>data source</b> produces the data to be sent</li>
                    <li>The <b>transmitter</b> encodes data into a signal suitable for a transmission medium.</li>
                    <li>The <b>transmission medium</b> is a device which allows the signal to be transmitted to the destination.</li>
                    <li>The <b>receiver</b> decodes the signal back into the original data, or an approximation of the data.</li>
                    <li>The <b>destination</b> is the receiver of the information.</li>
                </ol>

                A <b>protocol</b> is a set of rules that regulates transfer of data between computers.<br>
                <b>Handshaking</b> is an agreement about which protocol to use, made by devices that communicate with each other. <br>
                <b>Bandwidth</b> is the capacity of the transmission medium. A cable with high bandwidth can transfer more data than one with low bandwidth. 
                An example of a high bandwidth transmission medium is <b>fibre-optic</b>.<br>
                Speed of data transfer is measured by the number of <b>bits per second</b> or <b>baud rate</b>:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bits per second is the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted in one second.</li>
                    <li>Baud rate is the maximum number of data symbols or electrical signals that can be transmitted in one second.</li>
                </ul>
                <b><u>Error checking methods</u></b><br>
                There are three methods commonly used for error checking:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Parity checking</b> involves checking for errors using what is called a parity bit. 
                        <li>Odd parity bit checks if the number of ones in the transmitted bits is odd.
                        If the number of ones are even, then the parity bit is set to 1 to meet the criteria of odd parity. </li>
                        <li>Even parity bit checks if the number of ones in the transmitted bit is even, and the same principle of odd parity applies here. 
                            If there are an odd emount of ones, the parity bit is set to 1.</li></li>
                    <li><b>Checksum</b> involves the receiver checking for the total number of bits and comparing them to what was transmitted.</li>
                    <li><b>Cyclic redundancy check</b> is a method of checking for errors by using a divison process. The data is divided into predetermined lengths and divded by a fixed divisor.</li>
                </ul>
